# Unit-4-Game

The Crystal Collector! 

At the start of the game, a random number is generated. Beneath this random number are 4 crystals, each with a randomly-assigned value that can only be discovered by observing the total score when you click on each of the crystals. The object of the game is to figure out the point values for each crystal and then click on them to reach the random number generated by the code. 

Going over the random number is an automatic loss, wins and losses are tallied in the aqua div to the right of the random number div.
